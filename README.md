# Symphony
This is a Music App , fully created by me. Even the Music Player with all the 'Forward', 'Play' etc. buttons is created by me.
So ofcourse, it has some problems.
I know the problems, but somehow I don't find them intersting, so I have left them as they are.

<b>So what this app does?</b>
This app was created when I came to knew about Fragments in Android, that's it.
So, I didn't knew how to access phone memory at the time, but I so badly wanted to make this.
So, I did what is forbidden : Pasted the Songs (5, I guess) into the app itself, that is why it is so heavy.
When you click a song and you are connected to internet, this app fetches it's lyrics and shows it to you.
